# First person survival horror game project

Heal is a survival horror game project I started at University with aims to prove that games just like any other medium can evoke emotions in people.

As of version 1.0 Heal features:
- 3 Fully modeled maps.
- Fully functional GUI menus.
- FSM AI Characters.

In Unity go to-> Window->Package Manager-> Install Local Package-> import RetroTVFX/package.json
